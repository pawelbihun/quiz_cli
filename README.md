# Quiz in CLI

## A brief description
The script that loads a JSON file with the appropriate structure and based on it
runs a quiz that has a question and 4 possible answers. After going through all the questions
it is displayed how many questions the player answered correctly and the questions where are displayed
a mistake has been made along with information about the correct answer.
The project includes a sample exam for the ISTQB Foundation Level certificate
downloaded from [SJSI](https://https://sjsi.org/ist-qb/do-pobrania/) website.
